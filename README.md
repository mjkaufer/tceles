# tceles

Generate JavaScript to select DOM elements

## what?

tceles generates JavaScript for you to select a certain DOM element. I came up with the idea when trying to scrape a website - I got tired of manually generating a long JavaScript tag to access one element from a table, so if you input a DOM element, tceles will give you JavaScript to select it

## usage

After importing tceles, run `tceles(domElement)` with `domElement` being the element you want to find a path for
